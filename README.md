# Linear-Regression

This assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system. They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.  Models Build for answering and understanding the factors to increase demand.
